## Shared Libraries

In Jenkins, a shared library is a way to store commonly used code(reusable code), such as scripts or functions, that can be used by different Jenkins pipelines.

Instead of writing the same code again and again in multiple pipelines, you can create a shared library and use it in all the pipelines that need it. This can make your code more organized and easier to maintain.

Think of it like a library of books, Instead of buying the same book over and over again, you can borrow it from the library whenever you need it.


## Advantages

  1. Standarization of pipelines
  2. Reduce duplication code
  3. Easy onboarding of new applications and projects, teams
  4. One place to fix issues with shared or common code
  5. Code maintaince
  6. Reduce Risk of errors
